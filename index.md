I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Chicago. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Aaron Elmore](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aelmore/). 

My research focuses Database Systems. I currently focus on building resource adaptive query execution engines for cloud-native databases.
I am also interested in query optimization, transaction processing, and indexing techniques.

Before joining UChicago, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Tokyo.
