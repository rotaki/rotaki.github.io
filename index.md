I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, under the mentorship of Prof. [Aaron Elmore](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aelmore). My research is centered around Database Systems, with a particular emphasis on developing resource-adaptive query execution engines tailored for cloud-native databases. Additionally, I have a keen interest in query optimization, transaction processing, and indexing techniques.

Prior to my doctoral studies at UChicago, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Tokyo.

## Recent Projects

- **Fine-grained Control of Query Execution for Resource-adaptive Databases (2022-)**
  
  Developing a resource-adaptive query engine in Rust designed to boost the performance of cloud-based databases. This project prioritizes the dynamic execution of queries under fluctuating resource capacities. Our current focus areas include the suspension and resumption of queries, adjusting resource allocations in run-time, and query re-optimizations. The ultimate goal is to enhance the control over query execution, ensuring more accurate and efficient use of resources.

- **Designing Journal Storage for Optuna, a Hyperparameter Optimization Library (2022)**
  
  Contributed to the development of a journal log storage system for Optuna, a highly-regarded hyperparameter optimization library (over 8,000 GitHub stars). This system enhances large-scale distributed optimization tasks by eliminating the need for centralized database management and ensuring efficient recovery during worker node failures.

- **Benchmarking Concurrency Control Protocols for OLTP Workloads (2021)**
  
  Implemented and optimized various advanced concurrency control protocols (SILO, S2PL, MVTO) in C++, focusing on improving performance for OLTP workloads. Conducted detailed performance assessments under diverse operational scenarios using a comprehensive TPC-C benchmark suite to validate these improvements.
